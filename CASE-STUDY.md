## Project: NPM Resume Package - bhanu-n-tripathi

### 1. One-Line Description
**What problem does this solve?**
- Creates an interactive, beautifully formatted resume that displays directly in the terminal when someone runs `npx bhanu-n-tripathi`, making personal branding memorable and showcasing technical skills to potential employers or collaborators.

### 2. Problem-Solving Approach
**How did you approach solving the problem?**
- **Analysis Phase:** Studied the requirement to use LinkedIn ID as package name and researched npm package structure and publishing process
- **Design Decision:** Chose terminal-based display over web-based to make it unique, lightweight, and immediately accessible without browser dependencies
- **Data Structuring:** Organized resume information into logical sections (contact, experience, skills, education, volunteer work) for clean presentation
- **Visual Enhancement:** Implemented color-coded sections using chalk library and bordered boxes using boxen for professional appearance
- **Publishing Strategy:** Set up npm organization matching LinkedIn profile for consistent personal branding

**Challenges faced and solutions:**
- **Bin Configuration Issue:** Initially had mismatched package name and bin command, solved by ensuring consistency between package name and executable command
- **JSON Syntax Errors:** Missing commas in package.json caused publishing failures, resolved through careful syntax validation
- **Version Management:** npm doesn't allow republishing same version, learned to increment version numbers for updates
- **Terminal Compatibility:** Ensured cross-platform compatibility with proper shebang line and Node.js path

### 3. Tech Stack with Decision Reasoning 
**Technologies used and WHY you chose them:**

#### Core Runtime:
- **Technology:** Node.js
- **Why this choice:** Essential for npm packages, provides cross-platform compatibility, and has excellent terminal interaction capabilities. Alternative like Python would require additional setup on user machines, while Node.js is standard for developers.

#### Styling Libraries:
- **Technology:** Chalk (v4.1.2)
- **Why this choice:** Industry standard for terminal colors with excellent compatibility. Chose v4 over v5 because v5 is ESM-only which could cause compatibility issues. Alternative libraries like colors.js have less active maintenance.

- **Technology:** Boxen (v5.1.2) 
- **Why this choice:** Perfect for creating bordered terminal boxes with customizable styling. Creates professional visual separation between resume sections. No viable alternatives provide same level of customization for terminal UI.

#### Package Management:
- **Technology:** NPM Registry
- **Why this choice:** Largest JavaScript package repository, easy global distribution, and perfect for the requirement of using `npx` command. Alternative like GitHub Packages would have limited discoverability.

#### Development Tools:
- **Technology:** Git + GitHub
- **Why this choice:** Industry standard for version control and npm repository linking. Provides transparency and allows others to contribute or fork the project.

**Note:** Deliberately kept dependencies minimal (only 2) for fast installation and reduced security vulnerabilities compared to frameworks with hundreds of dependencies.

### 4. Video Demo
